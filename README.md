# Surveillance-Cameras

### CSC361 Artiticial Intelligence

## Intro 

Surveillance cameras are widely used for monitoring, however, installing a camera usually costs a lot. Therefore, in this project we aim to develop a program that finds the minimum number of cameras (and its location) needed to cover all spots in the room. Our program takes as input a text file that represents the map of a
room as a grid. Using Best-first search algorithms (Greedy search & A*) and Local search algorithms (Hill climbing & Simulated annealing) to find the minimum number of cameras that covers all the cells.
